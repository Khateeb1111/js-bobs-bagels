1 hour = Â£1.50

//this is what we expect calculateTotalCharge to return  when we oass in 1 hour 

//setup
output = expected
input = result (num in brackets)

const expected = 1.5

1 in brackets is 1 in test case so if 2 is in brackets 
1 in brackets is the input
expected is the output

addBagel(type)
the type parameter is representing the value of the type e.g. cinnamon or blueberry

when seeing type: type, this means:
- the first type is the object key
- the second type is the value of the parameter being parsed

the basket.addBagels add the bagels, and to verify that its been added we do const bagels (result) = basket.getBagels()
The getBagels checks to see if its been added as addBagels returns nothing

In execute, always call the getBagels method to check if your code runs
